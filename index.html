                    <p>I was moved to Dallas, TX from Korea(*South, Not North) in 2006.
                    I was living in Dallas for 6 years until I transferred to UT Austin 
                    from UT Dallas after my sophomore year, which was 2012.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>After I graduated UT Austin in 2014, I was working for Samsung for 3 years
                    and I am currently working for SIT-Tech Co., Ltd, our company does Industrial Automation for Samsung as a contractor.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Since I really want to change my career to Web Development, I hope I can make a great result out from this Bootcamp with my classmates!</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>For my free time, I like to play computer games, play soccer and watch random stuff from Youtube.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>However...I will try my best to utilize my free time to study coding x1000.</p>
